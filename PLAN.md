### Low-bandwidth proxy (`neutrino-lb`)

v1 done (JSON↔CBOR over HTTP). `neutrino-lb` is a standalone sidecar that
transcodes Server-Server federation **bodies** between JSON (local side) and
CBOR (wire side), behind a `WireClient`/`WireServer` trait seam (the future
CoAP/UDP transport drops in there). `neutrino-http` routes outbound federation
through it via the optional `Config.federation_proxy` (reqwest proxy mode);
`None` = direct (the default, so existing tests/deployments are unchanged). Two
homeservers behind two sidecars converge a real join + message — see
`crates/neutrino-http/tests/e2e_lb_federation.rs`. Design:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-neutrino-lb-cbor-proxy-design.md`.

Open question answered: CBOR/CoAP lives in the separate `neutrino-lb` crate,
**not** baked into the `Event`/`Request`/`Response` types — so it stays out of
Ruma's way and `neutrino-http`'s Router is untouched.

Deferred follow-ups (write-ups, not done):
- integer-key / enum-key CBOR codec + single-byte CoAP path enums (port of
  Dendrite `internal/lb` `cbor_codec.go` / `coap_paths*.go`); v1 is an **opaque**
  `JSON value ⇄ CBOR bytes` transcode. MSC3079:
  https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/kegan/low-bandwidth/proposals/3079-low-bandwidth-csapi.md
- the CoAP/UDP transport (second `WireClient`/`WireServer` impl, with
  blockwise/MTU handling) — gated on a Rust CoAP library investigation.
- per-hop timeouts on the sidecar's own reqwest clients (`LbConfig.timeouts`);
  today the originating `FederationClient` request timeout bounds the egress hop.

### Sliding sync (MSC4186) gaps

Intentional gaps in the sliding-sync implementation — see `MSC4186-gaps.md`:

- request filters (`is_dm` / `is_encrypted` / `is_invite` / `room_types` / `not_room_types`) are parsed but ignored
- lazy-loading members
- room heroes
- `expanded_timeline`
- state-stub emission for removed state (clients keep their stale view of removed state)

### createRoom

- `initial_state`, `power_level_content_override`, and `creation_content` are not honoured
- `trusted_private_chat`'s invitee power-level bump is not modelled (createRoom does not process the `invite` list for power levels)

### Client-Server follow-ons

- client-timeline filtering on `soft_failed`: the column + field exist, but relayed timelines do not yet drop soft-failed events
- room-alias resolution: `#alias` → room id is unresolvable (no alias directory); the global `/join/{roomIdOrAlias}` reports `M_INVALID_PARAM` on any alias
- `/forget`
- displayname / avatar carry-over onto membership events

### Server-Server follow-ons

- orphan-staging garbage collection: a max-age sweep of `staged_events` (federation gap-fill ancestry that never grounds)
- inbound `/get_missing_events` deterministic ordering: the spec wants min-hops + lexicographic, we sort by `origin_server_ts`; the responder also stops at `limit` rather than continuing to the create event (the multi-round requester compensates functionally)
- large state-DAG handling: `send_join` / `send_leave` serialize the whole state DAG into one response and state-res holds it in memory — streaming JSON is a future option if rooms get large

### Code-quality follow-ons (noted, not blocking)

- thread `own_server` as a parsed `OwnedServerName` rather than a `String` compared by value
- relocate `outbound_destinations` from the HTTP actor into `neutrino-state`
- fold the repeated `FederationClient` PUT-event idiom into one helper
- federated-invite error-code parity with the local invite path
- OOB-invite join review leftovers (noted, not blocking): `federated_join_if_remote` runs twice on the `join_by_id_or_alias`→`join` fall-through; a single private `join_core(hints)` would collapse it. No single shared "is this room remote / who is the inviter's resident server" predicate (invite/leave/join each re-derive it).
- multi-server / idempotency federation tests
- port the relevant Synapse + Complement membership-endpoint tests
- `storage_dir` empty-string handling: an exported-but-empty `NEUTRINO_STORAGE_DIR=` (and the FFI
  `NeutrinoConfig.storage_dir`) is taken literally as `""` rather than falling back to the default,
  aborting startup with an opaque `creating storage dir : …`; validate/normalise empty → default

## stack
- framework: axum + tokio
- serialization: serde + serde_json + some cbor library
- error handling: thiserror
- testing: cargo test + httptest

## architecture
storage is behind a StorageBackend trait — do not couple handlers to a concrete type.
SQLite is the only concrete implementation for now.
all handlers return Result<Json<T>, AppError>. AppError implements IntoResponse.
never use .unwrap() in handler code.

## non-goals (do not implement)
- Rate limiting
- Any authentication (access tokens) on the client-server API
- Tracing (distributed tracing / span instrumentation as telemetry) — note: basic HTTP request/response access logging IS in scope; that is not the same thing
- Restricted rooms (`join_authorised_via_users_server`) — documented, not implemented

## decisions log

### neutrino-lb CBOR proxy (2026-06-16)
- `neutrino-lb` is a **standalone sidecar proxy**; the CBOR transcode lives in it,
  not in `neutrino-http`'s HTTP layer.
- v1 is an **opaque** JSON↔CBOR transcode (no key remapping); the integer-key /
  enum-key codec is deferred.
- Outbound handoff is via **reqwest proxy mode** (one `Config.federation_proxy`
  field, default `None`); no URL construction or Router change in `neutrino-http`.
- `WireClient`/`WireServer`/`WireHandler` traits are scoped to the **wire hop
  only**; local hops stay plain HTTP. They are the CoAP seam; v1 ships one
  HTTP+CBOR impl (`transport::http`) behind them.
- HTTP-server substrate: **axum (`fallback`) + reqwest**.
- Deviations from the design spec (deliberate, recorded here rather than left
  silent): wire types were simplified — `WireRequest.dest: String` (not
  `OwnedServerName`), `body: Vec<u8>` (not `bytes::Bytes`), `LbConfig.upstream:
  String` (not `Url`); the `ruma`/`bytes` deps the spec listed were not pulled in.
  The ingress intentionally drops upstream **response** headers (Matrix S2S
  responses carry no semantic headers). Per-hop sidecar timeouts
  (`LbConfig.timeouts`) were not implemented (see deferred follow-ups).
- Forward risk (out of scope today): the JSON→CBOR→JSON round trip does **not**
  preserve byte-exact canonical JSON, so if event **signatures** are ever added,
  this proxy would break signature verification — it would have to canonicalize
  identically to the signer on both ends.
- In-process mode requires a loopback-reachable `bind_addr`: `upstream_url`
  rejects a concrete non-loopback address (e.g. a LAN interface) rather than
  sending the ingress→upstream hop off the loopback path (which would expose the
  unauthenticated CSAPI on the network). Loopback is used verbatim; `0.0.0.0` is
  rewritten to loopback (it still listens there). The sidecar config is
  derived/validated *before* binding the listener, so an illegal in-process combo
  fails fast without first claiming the public port. Deferred (option 2 of the
  review's finding #4): collapsing the three coupled `Config` fields (`bind_addr`
  / `federation_proxy` / `lb_ingress_bind`) into a `FederationMode { Direct |
  Proxied | InProcess }` enum so illegal states are unrepresentable at
  construction (incl. a fallible FFI `TryFrom`) — the current fix validates early
  but still surfaces the error at `entrypoint`.
